In this short film series, I will share some of my favorite short films and review them in each post.  Today, we are looking at the master piece "Крепость/Fortress" by Dimitry Fedotof:

Fortress is a cinematic endeavor that delivers in two minutes what most films fail to deliver in two hours.  The film captures a dystopian future with an openning sciene that does not hesitate to thrusts the viewer right into the very heart of this story.  From the deafining silence in the beginning to the hopeful tune of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony, the film's excellence in visual elements is also matched in the beauty of its soundtrack.

The film that I watched 10 years ago once and sepnt countless hours trying to find it again, illustrates a not too distant future in which our robotic machines continue to fight and disemate our cities and planet long after humans are gone.  The Fortress is an aircraft, a technological master peice that delivers death and distruction autonomusly without human intervention.  In all regards an embodiement of darkest corners of hate deep within the genetic codes of our species.  Robots fighting long after the last human is gone is perhaps the legacy we choose to exceelerate towards.

As the hydrogyn cluster bombs fall on what appears to be an already dystroed city, the on board computers mark the mission a success.  This cold dystopia that captivates us through the screen delivers a profound message that transpires within the lonesome silence to force us to ask the question about the possiblity for peice within our troubled world.  The film does not end without an important glimper of hope, a small plant growing within the ruins of the dystroied city.  A symbolic gesture to a hopeful future that resinates to the tune of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony to remind us that tomorrow could be better.

The anti-war message this film delivers without a cast (at least not living ones) and without conversations, masterfully haunts us with a sense of loneliness and fear.  Perhaps a fear that unless we change who we are today our future will not be too far from what is depicted by the short film "Fortress".  Fortess does not leave us without a glimer of hope, but it's the kind of hope we have to find within the contraditions of our collective unconscious.  And this is the true power of cinema, to probe the depths of the dialectical tensions that define our humanity and ignite our imaginations with lengering questions that force us to think and maybe become better humans.


In this series I review movies that are relevant to AI, technology, and Computer Science.  Suggest a movie for the next review, if you like this one.
