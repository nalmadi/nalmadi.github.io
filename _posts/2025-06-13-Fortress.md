In this short film series, I will be presenting and reviewing a selection of my favorite short films. Today’s feature is the remarkable work Крепость (Fortress) by Dmitry Fedotov.

Fortress is a cinematic endeavor that delivers in two minutes what most films fail to deliver in two hours. The film captures a dystopian future with an opening scene that does not hesitate to thrust the viewer right into the very heart of the story. From the deafening silence in the beginning to the hopeful tune of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony, the film's excellence in visual elements is matched by the beauty of its soundtrack.  The silence at the beginning is not merely the absence of sound, it is the sound of absence. 

This is a film I watched once, ten years ago, and spent countless hours trying to find again. It illustrates a not-too-distant future in which our robotic machines continue to fight and decimate our cities and planet long after humans are gone. The Fortress is an aircraft, a technological masterpiece that delivers death and destruction autonomously, without human intervention—an embodiment of the darkest corners of hate deep within the genetic code of our species. Robots fighting long after the last human is gone may be the legacy we are accelerating toward.

As the hydrogen cluster bombs fall on what appears to be an already destroyed city, the onboard computers mark the mission a success. This cold dystopia, which captivates us through the screen, delivers a profound message that emerges from the lonesome silence, forcing us to ask whether peace is possible in our troubled world. Yet the film does not end without an important glimmer of hope: a small plant growing within the ruins of the destroyed city. A symbolic gesture toward a hopeful future, resonating to the tune of Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony, reminding us that tomorrow could be better.  The ending with Tchaikovsky’s 6th Symphony, the Pathétique is not a coincidence. The symphony, written by a man on the verge of collapse, serenades a world already collapsed.

There are no actors in this film (at least not living ones). No dialogue. It is pure cinema in the sense that Tarkovsky might recognize: the image itself as idea. The anti-war message is not preached; it is etched into the visual syntax. Fortress haunts us precisely because it shows a world emptied of subjects, yet filled with the consequences of subjectivity.

In the end, the film does not say, “Be hopeful.” It says: hope is a contradiction. It is not a given, but a task, a political, ethical, existential imperative. And that, my friends, is the true power of cinema: not to entertain, but to disturb. Not to reassure, but to confront us with the horror (and the possibility) of what we are becoming.
