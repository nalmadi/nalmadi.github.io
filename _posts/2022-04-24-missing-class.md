title: The Mind Trick to Never Miss a Class
---

As a student, I had a single thought that made me go to class no matter how cold, ill, tired, or unprepared I was.  As an international student, I traveled over 6,000 miles with the sole purpose of being a student and attending classes.  If I don't go to class after traveling so far and finally reaching the city of my class, then I am giving up at the finish line.  This thought was always sufficient to get me out of the door, every time!
