This post is part of a student spotlight series highlighting the work of exceptional students.  The series aims to facilitate knowledge sharing among students on topics such as internships, jobs, and graduate school.  Today, I have the pleasure of talking to Emmanuel Assumang ‘25, a rising sophomore who will tell us about his internship experience at Microsoft this summer.

**Naser: Can you tell us about the internship you had this summer?  What kind of internship was it?**


Emmanuel: Explore Microsoft is a 12-week summer internship program for first and second-year college students. It is rotational and allows you to gain experience in SWE and PM roles. For my part, I worked with the Azure Machine Learning team under the AI Platform Team management, and it was such a great learning experience, and I am proud of the work I completed with my pod (since you are placed in a team of 3). Rotating between PM and SWE roles, not only did I learn new technologies and skills, I had a perfect, educational, and fascinating time working on the project. 


**Naser: How did you find this internship?  And why did you select it?**


Emmanuel: I searched Reddit and LinkedIn for opportunities geared toward first-year college students in tech. I also had friends already interning in big tech who directed me to various sources!


**Naser: Can you tell us about the interview process?  And how did you prepare for it?**


Emmanuel: My internship specifically was pretty straightforward about the application. After sending in your resume and applying through Microsoft’s career portal, if shortlisted/selected, a recruiter will reach out to you for the first round of interviews, which is a 30 mins behavioral phone call. The first round was pretty informal. If you pass, you’ll be contacted again to schedule a 90 mins (45-45 mins) back-to-back technical interview with two separate software developers. So it was three interviews! And the technical interview was based on problem-solving and taking the interviewer through your thought process.


**Naser: What kind of activities were you involved in during your internship?  And what aspects did you find most interesting?**


Emmanuel: Over the course of my internship, there were many fun and educational activities so I will mention a few. The biggest was the intern day event, packed with social gatherings and lots of fun things. Aside from that, we had engineering boot camps, meet and greet with full-timers, intern-cohort events, and presentation days! These were actually great and gave us the opportunity to network and learn more in a fun way.


**Naser: What tips would you give students interested in doing an internship in the future? You can mention any details that you like, including websites and other resources.**


Emmanuel: One thing people mostly overlook is creating a good LinkedIn and GitHub profile and keeping it up to date with your projects and achievements. Also, working on personal projects (like even a simple game ) and contributing to open source projects go a long way when placed on your resume and profiles. Try to connect to people as much as possible. Do not be scared to reach out! Start your internship search early.


**Naser: Thank you for sharing your experience, Emmanuel.  It was great hearing about your internship, and I am sure others will find your experience motivating and beneficial in their journey.**


Emmanuel: Thank you!
