So what's the difference between coding, programming, and software engineering?  Here's my informal answer in terms of the skills involved in each.


**Coding:** The ability to compose sequences of instructions that computers can follow to perform tasks in a given programming language.  The main skill here is writing (and understanding) syntactically correct code based on the rules of the programming language.


**programming:**  The ability to solve a well defined problem by writing programs that work efficiently.  The main skill here is problem solving from a well defined specification.


**Software Engineering:**  The ability to convert a real-world problem into a well defined specification.  Software Engineering skills involve organizing people and resources to help customers understand and articulate their real-world problems, so that such problems can be solved with maintainable software on time and within budget.  If this sounds tough, it is, but it's also fun!
