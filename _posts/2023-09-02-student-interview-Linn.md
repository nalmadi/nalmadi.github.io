This post is part of a student spotlight series highlighting the work of exceptional students.  The series aims to facilitate knowledge sharing among students on topics such as internships, jobs, entrepreneurship, and graduate school.  


Today, I have the pleasure of talking to Linn Cao Nguyen Phuong '24, who will tell us about her experience as a Software Engineering Intern at Credit Suisse this summer.


**Naser: Can you tell us about your role and responsibilities during your tech internship?**

During my internship, I had the privilege of assuming diverse and impactful responsibilities that contributed to the success of a project that was shared with 3 other interns. One of my main tasks involved designing an efficient SQLite database and constructing a responsive REST API using Flask and Python. This initiative aimed to centralize and standardize patent information from both Credit Suisse and UBS, streamlining their operations. To enhance accessibility, I was responsible for crafting the user interface using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Next.js, ensuring a user-friendly platform for patent data retrieval across the firms. 

An exciting aspect of my contribution was integrating the advanced GPT-3.5 model, which played a pivotal role in furnishing patent explanations and even generating patent filing sections based on user-provided descriptions. Throughout the internship, my team diligently followed Agile methodologies, engaging in daily standups with our project manager and weekly demonstrations to maintain alignment with stakeholders from various departments across the bank and uphold consistent project advancement.

**Naser: How did you find this internship? And why did you select it?**

Linn: I came across this incredible opportunity on LinkedIn. I was drawn to this internship because it allowed me to merge my Computer Science major with my Finance minor, and also because I wanted to explore the inner workings of a (once) global systemically important bank and contribute meaningfully to its operations.

**Naser: Can you tell us about the interview process? And how did you prepare for it?**

Linn: The interview process was conducted in two comprehensive rounds. The initial round delved into behavioral discussions where I shared my past experiences. The subsequent round was more technically intensive, encompassing a blend of theoretical concepts and live coding exercises, primarily in Javaâ€”a language I felt comfortable with. In preparation for these assessments, I dedicated time to revisiting core data structures and algorithms, and reinforcing fundamental theoretical knowledge.

**Naser: How did the internship align with your academic studies at Colby, and did it provide any unique perspectives or insights?**

Linn: Fortunately, the internship was beautifully built upon the foundation laid in my Software Engineering class (CS321), which you taught. I think that the experience was a tremendous learning opportunity about how a bank operates and the roles of its different departments. It also allowed me to practically apply and expand upon my classroom knowledge to create a product that genuinely benefited employees across these departments.

**Naser: What tips would you give students interested in doing an internship in the future?**

Linn: I'd advise fellow students to willingly step beyond their comfort zones. It's normal to encounter areas of unfamiliarity in a project, and there's no shame in seeking guidance and asking questions. Personally, I started with frontend work, and transitioning to backend felt a bit daunting due to the existing codebase. However, seeking advice from team members proved incredibly helpful, and the collaborative learning environment was enriching. As a result, I eventually contributed to both ends of the project, which was an incredibly rewarding experience.


**Naser:  Thank you for sharing your experience Linn!  It was great hearing about your internship, and I am sure others will find your experience motivating and beneficial in their journey.**


Linn: Thank you!
