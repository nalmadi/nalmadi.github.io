This post is part of a spotlight series highlighting the work of exceptional students and alumni.  The series aims to facilitate knowledge sharing on topics such as internships, jobs, entrepreneurship, and graduate school.  


Today, I have the pleasure of talking to Michael Ofori Tenkorang '26, who will tell us about his recent experience as an Explorer Software Engineering and Product Management Intern with the Xbox team at Microsoft.


**Naser: Can you tell us about your role and responsibilities during your tech internship?**



Michael: During my internship, I worked with the Xbox Gaming Accessibility Team at Microsoft, focusing on developing features for a pre-existing copilot to streamline the game accessibility testing process. I extensively used Python for training machine learning models with company internal tools and making inferences. For the front-end development, I utilized ReactJS, which was integral in creating user-friendly interfaces.



**Naser: How did you find this internship? And why did you choose it?**



Michael: I learned about this opportunity from friends who previously interned at Microsoft and other leading tech companies. I chose Microsoft for its inclusive work culture and commitment to empowering individuals. The prospect of contributing to gaming accessibility also appealed to me as an area where I could make a significant impact.



**Naser: Can you tell us about the interview process? And how did you prepare for it?**



Michael: Sure! After applying, I had a phone screen interview with a recruiter, followed by two more interviews – one behavioral and one technical. These were scheduled a month after the initial screen. I received an offer the day after these interviews. To prepare, I did extensive behavioral interview practice with peers and solved numerous problems on LeetCode to sharpen my technical skills.



**Naser: How did the internship align with your academic studies at Colby, and did it provide any unique perspectives or insights?**



Michael: The CS231 course I took at Colby was pivotal for my internship. It equipped me with the fundamental skills necessary for my role, especially in efficient problem-solving. Additionally, the internship offered practical insights into how theoretical concepts are applied in real-world tech solutions, which was immensely valuable.



**Naser: What tips would you give students interested in doing an internship in the future but not sure where to start?**



Michael: Start by exploring your interests. Utilize platforms like LinkedIn to connect with professionals and alumni who can offer guidance. Don't hesitate to apply broadly and practice for interviews – both technical and behavioral. Also, working on personal projects, contributing to open-source, and participating in hackathons can be a great way to build a strong portfolio.
