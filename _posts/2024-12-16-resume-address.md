Let’s talk about an old resume relic: your detailed home address. Do hiring managers really need to know you live at 123 Main Street, Apartment 4B? The answer is no. 🚫

Here’s why just listing something like "Greater Boston Area" is more than enough:

🔍 Privacy Matters
Your exact location isn’t relevant to your qualifications or fit for the role. In a digital age, protecting your personal information is essential.

🗺️ Flexibility First
By listing a region instead of a street address, you communicate proximity without boxing yourself into specifics. This is especially useful if you’re open to relocation or remote roles.

⏩ Streamline Your Resume
Your resume is prime real estate for showcasing skills, accomplishments, and value. Don’t waste space on details that don’t matter to your career journey.

🎯 Focus on What Counts
Recruiters care about your experience, skills, and how you’ll contribute to the team. Your zip code? Not so much.
