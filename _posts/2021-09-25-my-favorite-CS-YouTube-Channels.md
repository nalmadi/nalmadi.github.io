My mentors used to recommend books to me, today I recommend YouTube channels to my students.  Here are some of my favorite computer science YouTube channels.  Feel free to email me with a suggestion if you have a recommendation.



### 1. [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/c/K%C3%A1rolyZsolnai)
If you like AI, Machine Learning, or technology in general this channel will introduce you to the most recent and most interesting AI related research in a brief fun way.  Regardless of education level, you will be able to understand the main point of the reviewed papers and stay up to date on the fast moving field of Computer Science.   

### 2. [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/c/Freecodecamp)
If you want to learn actual, real, recent, popular, important, amazing coding skills, then Free Code Camp is your best resource.  Honestly, I canâ€™t believe that their courses are free, some of them are extremely well made and well presented.  I continue to watch material from this channel to learn recent tools and libraries, and also learn the different way of teaching tech topics.    

### 3. [DroneBot Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/c/Dronebotworkshop1)
Getting into the world of electronics can be challenging, but with new tools like Arduino and Raspberry-pi that got much easier.  This channel introduces important and foundational topics on electronics in an easy-to-follow way.  The topic choice and presentation are always interesting and timely to keep you informed of new ideas in the world of robotics and electronics. 

### 4. [Anton Petrov](https://www.youtube.com/c/whatdamath)
A computer scientist is a scientist for the most part.  More than anything we are concerned with the different ways of reaching the truth.  This channel focusses on recent research in fields outside of computer science for the most part.  Nonetheless, it is important to be informed and aware of research in other fields, and you never know what might inspire you to use your knowledge of computing in other fields of research. 

### 5. [Continuous Delivery](https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery)
I like to talk about Software Engineering and I like to listen to smart and experienced people talking about Software engineering.  This channel is exactly that!  I like the experienced delivery of concepts and the unique perspective of software practitioners.  This is a great way to stay updated with the current conversation in software development today, and the comment section is always rich in good arguments and real-life perspective. 


More soon!
