The internship application window has opened (a couple of weeks ago) for summer 2024.  Here are the steps I suggest for applying, if you are not sure where to start:

1- Get your resume together.  Here's an okay post on writing your first tech resume: https://nalmadi.github.io/Featured

2- Get your resume looked at by peers and mentors.  Also, our friends at DavisConnects give excellent feedback and professional guidance.

3- Find a list of summer 2024 tech internships, there are many, here's one: https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships
Keep in mind that 50% of tech internships are not at tech companies, so find other lists and widen your search.

4- Make applications to opportunities that you are genuinely interested in, and learn about the roles, technologies, and terminology in the process.

5- Prep for the technical interview by brushing up on data structures, Big O, and practicing technical interview questions.  There are many websites dedicated for technical interview questions, here's one: https://leetcode.com/

Finally, take this entire process as a learning experience that will help you practice the interview process and figure out what you would like to do in the future.

You got this!  Good luck to you all!
