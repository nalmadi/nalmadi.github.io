This post is part of a student spotlight series highlighting the work of exceptional students.  The series aims to facilitate knowledge sharing among students on topics such as internships, jobs, and graduate school.  Today, we interview Parth Parth '25, a rising sophomore who will tell us about his internship experience this summer.

**Naser: Can you tell us about the internship you had this summer?  What kind of internship was it?**


Parth: I worked with a nonprofit in Cambodia called the Developing Skills Organization as a Computer Teacher. It was an education-based internship where my responsibility was to make the students better at computer literacy




**Naser: How did you find this internship?  And why did you select it?**


Parth: I found the internship through OmPrakash and selected it because computer education is something I have been very passionate about and wanted to do for a long time.




**Naser: Can you tell us about the interview process?  And how did you prepare for it?**


Parth: The interview process was not like a job interview at all. It was a conversation about my past experience teaching and what dates I can contribute to volunteering in this position.




**Naser: What kind of activities were you involved in during your internship?  And what aspects did you find most interesting?**


Parth: I was mainly involved in lesson planning and teaching. I'd say the most interesting and arguably hard aspect was adapting to each child's way of learning.




**Naser: What tips would you give students interested in doing an internship in the future?  You can mention any details that you like, including websites and other resources.**


Parth: My biggest advice would be that no matter what your major is, the summer is a good time to explore other stuff. My internship teaching computers is definitely not tradition for a CS major, but I learnt a lot and had lots of fun doing it. OmPrakash has tons of social impact initiatives and i think you should look into it!




**Naser: Thank you for sharing your experience, Parth.  I am sure others will find your experience motivating and beneficial in their journey.**


Parth: My pleasure!
